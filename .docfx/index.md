# Extensions for Globalization by Codebelt

Originally, this project was part of **Cuemon for .NET**, but with the forthcoming release of .NET 9 (and what resembled circular reference dependencies), it was split into its own project.

This project is now part of [Extensions for Globalization API by Codebelt](https://github.com/codebeltnet/globalization).

[Cuemon for .NET](https://www.cuemon.net/) will pursue its original purpose; providing an addition/complement/sidecar to Microsoft .NET platform.

Proceed to the [docs](/api/Codebelt.Extensions.Globalization.html) to learn more about the capabilities of this project.
